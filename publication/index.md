## Open-source Software Security

The reuse of open-source software (OSS) provides efficiency for developers. However, unmanaged OSS reuse may lead to the propagation of vulnerabilities. We have conducted research to devise scalable and precise vulnerability detection techniques aimed at resolving security threats caused by vulnerable OSS reuse. Our techniques can actually be used to resolve vulnerabilities in real-world popular software programs (e.g., Android, Redis, Mozjpeg, etc.). In addition, our research papers have been published in international conferences, including V1SCAN [USENIX Security '23], MOVERY [USENIX Security '22], and VUDDY [S&P '17].
