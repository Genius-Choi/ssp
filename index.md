# Software Security and Privacy Laboratory @ Korea UNIVERSITY

Software Security and Privacy Laboratory (SSP Lab) was established in 2023. We conduct various research and projects to enhance software security and ultimately ensure the safety of the software ecosystem. In particular, we are interested in researching software vulnerability detection, open-source software security for secure supply chains, analysis of security in the software ecosystem, and studies related to security patches. The results of our research are being published in top-tier international conferences and journals.
